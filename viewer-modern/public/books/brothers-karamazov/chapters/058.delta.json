The prosecutor suggests the murder was committed through the garden door, not the window, and hints at Smerdyakov's possible involvement, which Mitya denies, expressing contempt for Smerdyakov's character. Mitya reveals his intention to commit suicide, refuses to disclose the source of a large sum of money, and consents to a thorough search of his person and clothes.",
