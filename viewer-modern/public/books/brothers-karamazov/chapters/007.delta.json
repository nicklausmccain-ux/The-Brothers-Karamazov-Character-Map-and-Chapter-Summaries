Fyodor Pavlovitch behaves like a buffoon, telling stories and making jokes that embarrass the other visitors, especially Miüsov and Alyosha. Despite the awkwardness, Father Zossima responds with patience and wisdom, advising Fyodor Pavlovitch on honesty and humility before leaving the room to attend other visitors.",
