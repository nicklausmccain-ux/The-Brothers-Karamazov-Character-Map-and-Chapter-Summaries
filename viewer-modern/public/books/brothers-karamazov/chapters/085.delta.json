He describes the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, and his three sons, focusing on the contradictory nature of the prisoner, Dmitri, who is torn between nobility and baseness. The speech also addresses Dmitri's financial disputes with his father and questions the credibility of Dmitri's claim about a bag of money he supposedly kept untouched.",
