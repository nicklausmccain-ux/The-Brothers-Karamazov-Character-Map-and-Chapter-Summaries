The Grand Inquisitor confronts Jesus, accusing Him of hindering the Church's authority and the suppression of human freedom for the sake of order and happiness, but Jesus responds only with a silent kiss. After the poem, Ivan and Alyosha discuss its meaning and their differing beliefs, ending with Ivan declaring his intention to leave and Alyosha rushing to visit the dying Pater Seraphicus.",
