  "story_summary": "The defense attorney argues that the accused did not premeditate the murder and that the presence of the pestle as a weapon was accidental. He suggests that Smerdyakov, not the accused, may have committed the murder, citing Smerdyakov's character, possible motives, and suspicious behavior. The attorney urges the jury to consider all possibilities carefully and not to convict based on circumstantial evidence alone.",
