  "story_summary": "Father Zossima's body is prepared for burial and placed in a coffin in his cell, where monks and visitors gather, expecting a miraculous sign. However, a foul smell of decomposition arises from the coffin, causing scandal and division among the monks, with some interpreting it as a divine judgment and others defending the elder's sanctity. Father Ferapont arrives, condemns the dead elder, performs a ritual to cast out evil spirits, and after a tense confrontation, Alyosha quietly leaves the hermitage, signaling a significant change in him.",
