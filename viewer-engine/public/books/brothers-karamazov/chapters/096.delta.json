  "story_summary": "Alyosha arrives late to the funeral of Ilusha, who died shortly after Mitya's sentencing, and is greeted by Ilusha's schoolboys who discuss Mitya's innocence. The funeral service is held in a poor church, with Snegiryov, Ilusha's father, showing signs of distress and grief, especially when placing flowers and bread on the grave as Ilusha had requested. After the burial, Alyosha speaks to the boys at Ilusha's stone, urging them to remember Ilusha and their shared kindness, and they all agree to keep his memory alive.",
