  "story_summary": "Ippolit Kirillovitch argues that the prisoner is sane but driven by jealousy, particularly over the three thousand roubles and his passion for Grushenka. The prosecutor details the prisoner's escalating jealousy and premeditation to murder his father, supported by a letter written two days prior to the crime. Despite efforts to borrow money and resist violence, the prisoner ultimately succumbs to jealousy and uses a brass pestle as a weapon in the murder.",
