He retrieves his pistols from Pyotr Ilyitch, buys a large quantity of provisions and champagne, and prepares to go to Mokroe, despite his bloodstained appearance and erratic behavior. Pyotr Ilyitch worries about Mitya's state and intentions, but Mitya insists on going, while Pyotr Ilyitch later tries unsuccessfully to get information from Fenya by knocking on Grushenka's house late at night.",
